    "Positive Laws and Statutory Interpretation": "There are two basic sources of law: positive law and common law. Positive law refers to human-made laws, while common law is considered universally accepted moral principles. Positive laws are enacted by legislative or official government bodies, while common law is developed through court decisions. In the US, positive laws are enacted by Congress at the federal level, while states have the power to enact their own laws in areas where the federal government has not acted. If there is a conflict between federal and state law, federal law overrides state law. Primary sources of positive laws include the federal constitution, state constitutions, statutes, and regulations. Secondary sources include restatements, books, treatises, and articles. Courts may engage in statutory interpretation through various methods, including reading the text, examining legislative history and intent, identifying desirable public policies, and finding precedents in previously decided cases."
