    "How To Write A Case Brief or Case Outline for Law School (With An Example)": "A case brief is a summary and analysis of a court opinion, used by students to understand a significant decision. It typically includes the parties involved, legal citation, and a summary of the court's reasoning. The brief provides a summary of the court's reasoning, which is an application of applicable rules to facts, resulting in a holding that answers legal issues and states what the court decided or ruled."
