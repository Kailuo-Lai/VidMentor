* In criminal law, the plaintiff is the government or state, acting as the prosecution.
* The defendant is a private party in both civil and criminal cases.

### Burden of Proof

* In civil law, the burden of proof is a preponderance of evidence.
* In criminal law, the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt.

### Sanctions

* In civil cases, sanctions include damages, injunctions, and equitable remedies.
* In criminal law, sanctions include incarceration, fines, and penalties.

### Societal Goals
