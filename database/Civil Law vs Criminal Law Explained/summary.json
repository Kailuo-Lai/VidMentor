    "Civil Law vs Criminal Law Explained": "In civil law, the plaintiff is a private party, while in criminal law, it's the government or state. In both cases, the defendant is a private party. The burden of proof is higher in criminal law, requiring evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. Sanctions in criminal law can be more drastic, including incarceration and fines. Civil law focuses on compensation and deterrence, while criminal law prioritizes specific and general deterrence, with a strong punitive element."
