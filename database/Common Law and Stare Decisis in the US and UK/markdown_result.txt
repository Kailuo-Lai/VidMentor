# Stare Decisis and Common Law
## Principle of Stare Decisis
### Definition and Importance

Stare decisis is a fundamental principle in common law, derived from the Latin phrase "stand-on decided cases". It means that once a decision has been made, it should be left decided.

## Types of Stare Decisis
### Vertical Stare Decisis
#### Following Superior Court Precedents

Courts are obliged to follow the precedents of superior courts.

### Horizontal Stare Decisis
#### Following Own Prior Decisions

Courts should follow their own prior decisions.

## Application of Stare Decisis
### In the UK and US

The stare decisis principle applies in both the UK and the US, with some differences in its application.

### In the US

* All courts are bound to follow the rulings of the Supreme Court as the highest court in the country.
* Decisions by the Court of Appeals are binding for lower courts in their districts or circuits.
* State courts are bound by Supreme Court precedents, but not by federal court precedents.

## Exceptions to Stare Decisis
### Departures from Precedent

The stare decisis principle is not absolute, and the US Supreme Court has developed principles that allow departures from precedent.

### Reasons for Departure
#### Unworkable and Irrelevant Doctrine
#### Confusing Line of Cases
#### Changing Facts and Society

Departures from precedent are justified in instances where a specific doctrine has become unworkable and irrelevant, or where it has become needlessly obscured by a confusing line of cases.
