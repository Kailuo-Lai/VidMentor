    "Common Law and Stare Decisis in the US and UK": "Stare decisis is a principle in common law that requires courts to follow their own prior decisions and those of superior courts. It applies in both the UK and US, with some differences in scope. In the US, Supreme Court decisions are binding for all lower courts, while Court of Appeals decisions are persuasive authority. Departures from precedent are allowed when a doctrine becomes unworkable or facts change, as seen in the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The doctrine provides certainty and predictability, but can result in a lack of flexibility and inability to adapt to changing realities."
