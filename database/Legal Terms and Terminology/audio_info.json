        " read cases as well as other legal documents., Lawyer, Attorney, and Counsel., In legal disputes, each party ordinarily is represented by a lawyer., However, in the US, lawyers are often also referred to as attorney or counsel.",
        " Barister and Solicitor., In the UK, when referring to lawyers, the terms solicitor and barrister are commonly, used., But there is a difference between the two., Quite simply, baristers tend to practice as advocates representing clients in court.",
        " In contrast, solicitors tend to perform the majority of their legal work in a law firm, or office setting., They don't appear in front of courts themselves., Rather, if there's a need to do so, they will instruct a barrister.",
        " Judge, Court, and Justice., Judges are the trier of facts., They're the ones that decide cases., Depending on the specific court, one or more judges together form the court, which is the",

        " address the judge as your honor., Judges are sometimes also referred to as justice., All US Supreme Court justices are called justices., In the United Kingdom, it depends on the level of court how judges are addressed.",
        " In addition to your honor, for many courts it is common for baristers appearing in front, of it to address the judges as my lord or my lady., Including at the Supreme Court level where the judges are called lords or ladies.",
        " Appeal, Appellant, Appellee., Most opinions that are read in law school and that we discuss in our courses are appellate, opinions., That means that they decide or have decided the outcome of an appeal., An appeal is a legal proceeding that considers whether another lower court's legal decision",
        " was right or wrong., After a court has ruled for one side, the losing side may seek review of that decision, by filing an appeal before a higher court., During the proceedings before the higher court, the party that lost at the original court",
        " and is therefore filing the appeal is usually known as the appellant., The party that won in the lower court and must defend the lower court's decision is, known as the appellee.",
        " Petition, Petitioner, Respondent., Some courts label an appeal as a petition and require the losing party to petition the, higher court for relief., In these cases, the party that lost before the lower court and is filing the petition",
        " for review is called the petitioner., The party that won before the lower court and is responding to the petition in the higher, court is called the respondent."
