    "The US Court System Explained _ How the United States Court System Works": "The United States has a dual court system with federal and state courts, with the U.S. Supreme Court at the top. Federal courts include U.S. District Courts and Courts of Appeal, while state courts have jurisdiction over disputes with some connection to a U.S. state. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over certain cases and appellate jurisdiction, allowing it to hear cases on appeal. It also has the power of judicial review, established by the Marbury v. Madison case in 1803, to declare legislative or executive acts in violation of the Constitution."
