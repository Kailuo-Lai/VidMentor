    "Why Do We Need Law or Laws in Society_": "Law is necessary to achieve specific goals, such as establishing a market-based system, protecting society from market failures, and ensuring fairness. Laws aim to prevent harm, ensure a safe and peaceful society, and maintain social order. Businesses benefit from the law in various ways, including stability and predictability of contracts, protection from lawsuits, and creation of peaceful environments. The legal system provides infrastructure, education, and access to productive workers, travel, and goods transportation. Businesses can operate as limited liability entities and access capital markets, highlighting the importance of a functioning legal system. The relationship between business and law is circular, with law governing business and business influencing law directly and indirectly."
