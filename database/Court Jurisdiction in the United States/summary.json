    "Court Jurisdiction in the United States": "Jurisdiction refers to a court's power to hear a case, with three basic aspects: subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, and in rem jurisdiction. Subject matter jurisdiction determines whether a court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case, while personal jurisdiction determines whether a court has jurisdiction over a specific person or not. Courts in the state where a defendant resides have jurisdiction over that person, but courts in other states don't. Implied consent and explicit consent to jurisdiction are possible. Businesses can be subject to jurisdictions outside their home state if they conduct business elsewhere, under the minimum contact test and long-arm statutes. The leading case on business and minimum contacts is International Shoe Company vs. State of Washington, a 1945 Supreme Court decision. In e-commerce, some courts have held that an interactive website can establish personal jurisdiction in locations where users access the site, but a passive web page is insufficient. In rem jurisdiction refers to a court's power to decide cases concerning a specific property, regardless of the parties involved."
