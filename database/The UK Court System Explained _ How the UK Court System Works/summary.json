    "The UK Court System Explained _ How the UK Court System Works": "The UK court system has a hierarchical structure, with the Supreme Court at the top, followed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court. The High Court has three divisions: Queen's Bench, Chancery Division, and Family Division. The Crown Court and Magistrates Court handle criminal law cases, while county courts and family courts handle civil law and family law issues. The UK Supreme Court is located in Westminster, London, and hears cases with 5, 7, or 9 justices, with overall verdicts achieved by unanimity or simple majority. The Supreme Court is responsible for hearing cases for the entire UK in civil cases, and for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in criminal cases, but not for Scotland."
