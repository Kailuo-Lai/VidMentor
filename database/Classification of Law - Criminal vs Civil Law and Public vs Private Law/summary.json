    "Classification of Law - Criminal vs Civil Law and Public vs Private Law": "Law can be divided into public law and private law. Public law sets rules for government and its branches, while private law deals with relationships between individuals. Public law includes constitutional, administrative, tax, criminal, and procedural law, while private law covers contracts, tort law, business organizations, property ownership, and family rights. Criminal law deals with behavior that's an offense against the public, society, or state, while civil law deals with behavior that causes injury to an individual or private party. Both criminal and civil law can be initiated, decided, and punished differently."
