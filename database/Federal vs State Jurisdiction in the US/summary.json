    "Federal vs State Jurisdiction in the US": "Federal courts have jurisdiction over cases involving the U.S. as a party, diversity of citizenship, and cases with a value exceeding $75,000. They also have jurisdiction in bankruptcy, copyright, patent, and maritime cases. State courts have jurisdiction over other cases, including traffic violations, criminal offenses, contractual issues, and tort cases, with a protection of bias against non-residents. Both state and federal courts can have partial jurisdiction over certain cases, and securities laws are subject to both federal and state jurisdiction."
