# Law and Ethics
## Definition of Law
### Enforceable Rules

Law is not about informal customs or norms. It consists of enforceable rules that can have far more drastic consequences if ignored.

## Relationship Between Ethics, Morality, and Law
### Interconnections

Ethics, morality, and law are related, with interconnections between them. A judge or jury's assessment of the ethical character of an action may determine how the law is interpreted and applied in a given case.

## Characteristics of Legal Rules
### Generality, Stability, Prospectivity, Promulgation, Clarity, Non-Contradiction, Congruence, Possibility

Legal rules must possess eight characteristics to be considered legal rules: generality, stability, prospectivity, promulgation, clarity, non-contradiction, congruence, and possibility.
