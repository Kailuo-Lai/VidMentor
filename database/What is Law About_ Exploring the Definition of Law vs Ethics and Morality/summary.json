    "What is Law About_ Exploring the Definition of Law vs Ethics and Morality": "The law is not based on informal norms and customs, but rather enforceable rules. It can include rules considered wrong or immoral, and an action can be unethical but still legal. The law helps define roles and behaviors, reflecting societal consensus on what constitutes appropriate behavior. Legal rules should be formulated with four key principles in mind: general applicability, stability, prospectivity, and promulgation. They should be clear and understandable, not contradict each other, consistent with announced and applied rules, and feasible for those subject to them."
